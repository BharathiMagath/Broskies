# Employee Sorting with Comparator in Java

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project demonstrates how to use **Java Collections** and implement sorting with **Comparator**.  
You will learn how to sort objects dynamically by different fields such as **salary** (descending) and **name** (ascending).

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Required
- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code)

---

## ðŸ“š Key Concepts
- Working with `String` class
- Using loops and conditional statements
- Implementing `toString()`
- Using `ArrayList`
- Sorting with `Comparator` and `Collections.sort()`
- Lambda expressions for sorting

---

## ðŸš€ Steps Implemented
1. Create `Employee` class with `name`, `age`, and `salary`.
2. Add constructor and `toString()` method for easy display.
3. Store multiple employees in an `ArrayList`.
4. Sort employees by **salary (descending)** using `Comparator`.
5. Sort employees by **name (ascending)** using another `Comparator`.
6. Print both sorted lists.
